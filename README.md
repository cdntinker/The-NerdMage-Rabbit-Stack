# The __Nerd Mage "Universal" USB-C Board__  Project

**_This project is still a mostly untested WIP._**

The basic concept is a USB-C PD-capable power input section for various projects.  The initial board design & format is based on an ongoing project where 34x34mm is the maximum available space for this portion of the design.

In fact, the first USB power board for that project was 35x26mm & a photo of it is [in the Pix folder here](Pix/The-Original.png).  You can see that it was a very minimal USB-C to 3v3 power supply.

Now...

Many rabbit-holes later...

This project is becoming a fairly comprehensive PD client system.
