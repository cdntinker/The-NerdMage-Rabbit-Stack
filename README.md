# This is __The Nerd Mage "Universal" USB-C Board__  Project

**_This project is still a mostly untested WIP._**

The basic concept is a USB-C PD-capable power input section for various projects.  The initial board design & format is based on an ongoing project where 34x34mm is the maximum available space for this portion of the design.
