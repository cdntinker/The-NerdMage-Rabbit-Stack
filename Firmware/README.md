# The __Nerd Mage "Universal" USB-C Board__  Project

No actual firmware in this one.

Yet...

Nothing to see here...

Move along...

Or, maybe go bug Austins_Creations to work out the library...

In theory, the STUSB4500 can be configured to do PD in a standalone mode.

So...

The eventual firmware will have both realtime control AND the ability to set up the STUSB4500 & then be disconnected.

And, of course, now that the project has grown out of control...  There will likely be need for even more firmware.
